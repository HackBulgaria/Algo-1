out of different coins. The coins you have are of value 1, 2, 5, 10,
20, 50 and 100.

## Input

The input consists of a single line that contains the goal sum S.

## Output

Output the number of ways this sum could be build using coins of any
value amongst 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100. You could use as many coins
as you want from any value.

## Limits

```
1 <= S <= 1000
```

## Example

Input:

```
25
```

Output:
