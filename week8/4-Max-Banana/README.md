# Max Banana

A monkey starts jumping from the bottom left cell of a NxN grid.
Each cell of the grid contains a certain amount of bananas.
The monkey can jump only one cell to the right or one cell up.
Going back is not allowed. When the monkey is in a given cell,
it collects all the bananas which are there.

What is maximum number of bananas the monkey can collect going
only in the allowed directions?

## Input

The first line will contain N - the size of the grid.
The next N lines will contain N integers each - the number of bananas
in the corresponding cell in the grid.

## Output

Output the maximum number of bananas the monkey can collect.

## Limits

```
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= bananas in each cell <= 1000
```

## Example

Input:

```
5
9 3 4 1 5
1 7 1 9 1
4 2 1 3 4
2 1 2 2 1
1 3 2 1 7
```

Output:
