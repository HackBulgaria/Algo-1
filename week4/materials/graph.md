# Graph

Graphs are used for modeling relations between entities. Be it
connecting cities with streets and highways or representing
friendships between groups of people. Graphs are a powerful
abstraction that removes the details and lets us focus on
the algorithmic problems. We are about to study algorithms
that could be applied on any dataset that could be modeled as
a graph.
