[Graphs](materials/graph_traversals.md) are one big topic crucial to
algorithms and problem solving. We'll start looking at different ways
to [represent graphs in memory](materials/graph_representation.md) and
[traverse them](materials/graph_traversals.md).
[Here](materials/graph_properties.md) are some important properties
and different types of graphs.
