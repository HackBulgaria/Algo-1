[Graphs](materials/graph_traversals.md) are one big topic crucial to
algorithms and problem solving. We'll start looking at different ways
to [represent graphs in memory](materials/graph_representation.md) and
[traverse them](materials/graph_traversals.md).
[Here](materials/graph_properties.md) are some important properties
and different types of graphs.

## Tasks

1. [Closest Coffee Store](1-Closest-Coffee-Store/README.md) - Find the
  closest coffee store to a point.
1. [Valid Directories](2-Valid-Directories/README.md) - Check if all
  directories in a file system are valid.
1. [Phone Numbers](3-Phone-Numbers/README.md) - Save on phone bill by
  distributing phone calls amongst students.
