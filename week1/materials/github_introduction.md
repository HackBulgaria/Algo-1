# Github introduction

Github allows you to share your code with other developers and work on
projects simultaneously. Github plays key role in our Algo course as it
is the location where we store materials and tasks. Here are some tutorials
that will get you up to speed:

* [TryGit](https://try.github.io/)
* [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [Github Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

After going through the tutorials you should know how to `add`, `commit`,
`push`, `pull` and check the `status` of a Git repository.

You should also be able to `create` and `fork` repositories in Github.
