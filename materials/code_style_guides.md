It is very important to write code following guidelines. Especially in a
group environment such as the Algorithms course. Many people will read at
your code as you'll be reading at theirs. It would be much more easier if
their code looked exactly like yours. This is why we will impose code standards
for the programming languages that we use. Please follow them strictly as
this would make the process of learning and sharing much easier.
