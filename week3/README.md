# Week 3

Continuing the topic from the last week, we will look further into the details
of the Heap and Binary Search Tree structures. We will explore more problems
and tasks which these structure solve, as well as some real-world applications
of them.

In addition, we have included another interesting binary tree structure -
the [Binary Indexed Tree](materials/binary_trees.md#binary-indexed-tree).

The [materials](materials/binary_trees.md) this time include short
presentations which demonstrate the basic operations of the structures and include
some nice figures.

## Tasks

1. [BST](1-BST/README.md) - Check if binary tree is a binary search tree.
1. [Min/Max Heap](2-Min-Max-Heap/README.md) - Check if binary tree is a min/max heap.
1. [Online Median](3-Online-Median/README.md) - Find the median of a sequence
  on each insert
1. [Phone Book 2](4-Phone-Book-2/README.md) - Implement an efficient phone book
  with add, remove, search and list operations
1. [Bandwidth Manager](5-Bandwidth-Manager/README.md) - write a simple packet
  scheduler for a router.
1. [Birthday Ranges 2](6-Birthday-Ranges-2/README.md) - An update of a previous
  task. Find the number of people with birthday in a specific range.
1. [Range Minimum Query](7-Range-Minimum-Query/README.md) - Find the minimum value
  in a range.
1. [Jumping Soldiers](8-Jumping-Soldiers/README.md) - An interesting task from
  a real programming competition.
