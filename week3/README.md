Continuing the topic from the last week, we will look further into the details
of the Heap and Binary Search Tree structures. We will explore more problems
and tasks which these structure solve, as well as some real-world applications
of them.

The [materials](materials/binary_trees.md) this time includes a couple of short
presentations which demonstrate the basic operations of the structures and include
some nice figures.
