Continuing the topic on fundamental algorithms we'll study
[searching](materials/searching.md) which turns out to be a key problem in
algorithm design. Check out the algorithm steps and then look at
[this article](http://goo.gl/LwxnSy) :)

The time has come to move on to data structures that are not linear. This
lecture we'll be looking at [binary trees](materials/binary_trees.md) and
interesting ways of solving problems with them.

## Tasks

1. [Roots](1-Roots/README.md) - Find the square root of a number using binary search.
1. [Birthday Ranges](2-Birthday-Ranges/README.md) - Find the number of people
  with birthday in a specific range.
1. [Quadruplets](3-Quadruplets/README.md) - How many quadruplets from four
  vectors sum to zero.
1. [Phone Book](4-Phone-Book/README.md) - Find the names corresponding to a number
  in a phone book.
1. [Heap Sort](5-Heap-Sort/README.md) - Implement efficient sorting using heaps.
1. [K Lists](6-K-Lists/README.md) - Merge k sorted lists in a single one.
1. [K Min](7-K-Min/README.md) - Find the k-th smallest element in an unsorted collection.
