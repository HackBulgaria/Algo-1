# Phone book

Implement a function in [Java](PhoneBook.java), [Python](phone_book.py)
or [C++](phone_book.cpp) that given a vector of pairs (names and phone numbers)
and another vector of phone numbers finds the names that correspond to the phone
numbers in the second vector.

## Example

Input:

```
[(1, "Stanislav"), (15, "Rado"), (6, "Ivan"), (8, "Ivan")]
[15, 8]
```

Output:

```
["Rado", "Ivan"]
```
