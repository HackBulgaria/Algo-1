# K Intersect

Create a program that given K lists outputs
the elements that are present in every list.

## Input

The first line reads `N` - the number of lists that
follow. Each of the other `N` lines starts with a number
`M` which tells how many numbers follow. Those numbers
form a list.

## Output

The numbers that are present in the intersection of
the lists each on separate line.

## Limits

```
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= M <= 100000
```

## Example

Input:

```
3
5 2 5 10 3 1
8 7 13 3 9 2 55 47 10
3 42 2 3
```

Output:

```
2
3
```
